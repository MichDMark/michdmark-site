## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers the best developer experience for building React applications. With the **App Router**, we get:

1. Server Components by default
2. Simplified routing
3. Great performance

This portfolio is built with simplicity in mind.

### The Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Content**: Markdown (using gray-matter)
